    <h1>Here are some of my interests</h1>
    <hr/>
    <ul>
        <li>A new interest I have acquired is
            in UX Design.<br/> I recently started a
            UX Design specialisation on
            Coursea offered<br/> by Google and I
            am of the view that UX holds<br/>
            great potential for me and so far
            is the most<br/> interesting subfield in
            Computer Science for me.
        </li>
        <li>Reading. I love reading.
            My favroutite book so far has<br/>
            been the Red Rising
        </li>
        <li>
            I am a practicing muslim. Lately
            I have become much<br/> more closer 
            to Allah and I am thinking about
            learning <br/>Arabic to understand 
            the Quran more clearly.
